## Project Information

### Integrating an AWS maintained terraform open source solutions to backsstage terraform integrations:

1. Make sure the AWS maintained terraform open source solutions is popular and helps the community and customers. Please use this guideline on [Templating of Terraform Modules](https://cnoe.io/docs/reference-implementation/extensions/tf-templating) to templatize existingAWS maintained terraform open source solution.
2. Create a new `ClusterWorkflowTemplate` and other required supporting Kubernetes resource such as namespace, service account etc in [base](./argo-workflows-templates/base) folder. Make sure to add your new files to [kustomization file](./argo-workflows-templates/base/kustomization.yaml).
3. Create a new folder under `backstage-templates-for-eks` if your integration is a non-existant AWS maintained terraform open source solution and create sub folder for the respective solution and create required files such as `catalog-info.yaml` and manifests to support your solution. You can take a look in to our `data-on-eks` and `eks-observability-accelerator` examples.
4. Finally update the [catalog-info.yaml](./backstage-templates-for-eks/catalog-info.yaml) with references to your new templates of your solution integration.
